### Downloading

You can find the Yup extension on our site or download it directly on the Google Chrome Store.

### Access

Currently, you must own a university email \(.edu\) or receive an access code to use the extension. If you donâ€™t have one, apply [here](https://join.yup.io/) or through the extension. You can receive one from the Yup team or an existing user.

### Username and Password

All you have to do is pick a username and password and your Yup Account will be created.

It's important to note that there is no way to retrieve your password. Because Yup accounts are self-custodied, there is no 'find my password' option.  
{% endhint %}

If you sign up for a _decentralized account_, you should download and save your backup key, in case you lose access to your account for some reason.
