## Feed

The Feed is a culmination of the internet’s best content curated to fit a mood or topic. It includes embedded media such as tweets, YouTube videos, SoundCloud songs, Subreddits, and many more. Currently, there are 5 feeds that you can choose from. Soon users will be able to customize their feeds based on accounts, circles, or topics.

## Lists

Lists aggregate Yupster's opinions into rankings to help you find the best of what’s been rated on Yup. Find the smartest people on Twitter, the funniest Reddit posts, the most knowledgeable professors, and more flipping through our lists. Lists are totally public––you don’t need a Yup account to use it! Filter by site, subject, and category to find what you’re looking for.

**Advanced**  
Lists are **weighed** by each category separately and distinctly. That means that the usage and influence being spent in a category determines its relevance on lists.
