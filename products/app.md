## Lists

Lists aggregate Yupsters' opinions into rankings to help you find the best of Yup. Find the smartest people on Twitter, the funniest Reddit posts, the most knowledgeable professors, and more through our lists. Lists are totally public––you don’t need a Yup account to use it! Filter by site, subject, and category to find what you’re looking for.

**Advanced**\
Lists are **weighed** by each category separately and distinctly. That means that the usage and influence being spent in a category determines its relevance on lists.
