# FAQ

### Yup Account:

**Why hasn't my account been approved?**

Your account can take up to 72 hours to be approved.

**How do I reset my password?**

Unfortunately, you cannot reset your password. However you can create a new account using another email or Twitter account and we will approve you ASAP!

**I have been approved but I can't login. What should I do?**

If you sign up with your email on [yup.io](http://yup.io) and receive approval that only means that your email has been approved not that your account has been created. To create your account, download the [Yup extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yup-the-opinion-layer-of/nhmeoaahigiljjdkoagafdccikgojjoi?hl=en) and use your approved email to sign up. Feel free to contact us if you're still having trouble!

**Why am I getting a message that says email not found?**

If you have signed up on [yup.io](http://yup.io/) and been approved, your email has been approved but you still need to create an account w/ that email to finalize sign-up. Try signing up on the extension rather than logging in. 

**Can I unlink my Twitter account?**

You can unlink your Twitter account by opening your Twitter web app and clicking settings --&gt; security & account access --&gt; apps & sessions --&gt; connected apps --&gt; yup.io --&gt; revoke access. However, once a Twitter account is linked to a Yup account, you can't make a second account and link it to that same Twitter account.
