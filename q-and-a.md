# Q&A

#### Yup Account:

**Q: Why hasn't my account been approved?**

A: Your account can take up to 72 hours to be approved.

**Q: How do I reset my password?**

A: Unfortunately, you cannot reset your password. However you can create a new account using another email or Twitter account and we will approve you ASAP!

**Q: I have been approved but I can't login. What should I do?**

A: If you sign up with your email on [yup.io](http://yup.io) and receive approval that only means that your email has been approved, not that your account has been created. To create your account, download the Yup extension and use your approved email to sign up. Feel free to contact us if you're still having trouble!

**Q: Why am I getting a message that says email not found?**

A: If you have signed up on [yup.io](http://yup.io/) and been approved, your email has been approved but you still need to create an account w/ that email to finalize sign-up. Try signing up on the extension rather than logging in. Feel free to contact us if you're still having trouble!

**Q: Can I unlink my Twitter account?**

A: Unfortunately once a Twitter account is linked to a Yup account, you can't make a second account and link it to that same Twitter account.

#### Bridge/Staking:

**Q: How do the YUP Bridges work?**

A: The YUP bridge converts YUP tokens \(and YUPETH tokens\) to ERC-20 tokens and back.

**Q: How do I swap my YUP to ETH?**

A: In order to get your YUP onto Ethereum. You first need to send the YUP you have in the extension to an Ethereum wallet. To do so click the Extension --&gt; Menu --&gt; Wallet --&gt; Send to Crypto Address, and then put in your Ethereum wallet address in the memo field. Then you should be able to connect your wallet to Uniswap \(the link I sent you\) and then exchange your YUP for eth.

**Q: What is YUPETH?**

A: YUPETH represents YUP-ETH LP tokens on EOS. You receive your UNI v2 LP token from adding liquidity to the YUP-ETH pool on Uniswap, and when bridge it over to EOS it is converted into the YUPETH token. You can stake the YUPETH token in [Yup.finance](http://yup.finance) to liquidity mine YUP.

**Q: What/How do I stake on Yup Racing?**

A: You stake YUP ETH Uniswap LP's. To do that, bridge your YUP tokens using the extension or the EOS &lt;&gt; Eth bridge. Then add YUP and ETH in the YUP ETH liquidity pool. Finally, take your LP token and bridge it back to EOS stake it in Yup Racing and off you go! Check out these tutorials for a step-by-step breakdown
