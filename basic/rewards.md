### How to make money

Users earn money by receiving YUP tokens for rating content.

#### The Process

The Yup [protocol](https://github.com/Yup-io/yup\_docs/tree/24938ac610bbd465109806ec69fb9e97054f2399/protocol.md) determines the monetary value of each vote based on each voter's [influence](https://docs.yup.io/#/protocol?id=influence).&#x20;

For example, if 100 [YUP](https://github.com/Yup-io/yup\_docs/tree/24938ac610bbd465109806ec69fb9e97054f2399/token.md) is being distributed in a given hour, and the users' influence makes up 5% of all rating influence in that hour, their rating is worth 5 YUP. The Yup Protocol then distributes YUP tokens to all other users who gave the same rating, as well as the creator of the content.

1. You rate content on a scale of 1-5.
2. Someone else gives that content the same rating.
3. You receive a portion of the monetary value of their rating.
4. And so on! The more ratings that agree with you, the more you earn.

**Vote Value**

When content is rated, approximately 50% of rewards are given to its creator (if one exists). The rest is split between previous raters in proportion to their influence.

**Not every opinion earns rewards.** Your opinion doesn’t make you money simply because you expressed it. It’s only worth something _if others agree_. If nobody rates the same as you, it means you’re late or your opinion is unpopular, so it does not merit rewards.

#### Measuring Influence

Your [influence](https://docs.yup.io/#/protocol?id=influence) (IN) is a measure of social value on Yup. Influence is calculated from your YUP token holdings and rewards previously received. As the Yup Protocol evolves, additional factors will affect your influence score.
