# Colors

Yup displays social value via colors that underline rated content and users in the extension and the web application. Each color represents a percentile value in relation to everything else in their category.

## Color Scheme

There are currently five colors:

1. Green: top 20%
2. Yellowish Green: 20 - 40%
3. Yellow: 40 - 60%
4. Orange: 60 - 80%
5. Red: 80 - 100%

**For example, the color of the most socially valued 'tweet' would be green or blue.**

**...And the least valuable would be red.**

Content becomes greener when you rate it positively and redder when you rate it negatively, reflecting an increase or decrease in the content's social value.

**Advanced**

Each piece of content can have a different color for EACH category. Within each category, that content is being related to other content within that category.

## Conclusion

We hope that, over time, each piece of content will be underlined with the color that accurately represents its social value according to the opinions of the online community. See [Categories](categories.md)
