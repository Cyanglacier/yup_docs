# Rating

## Rating (Dots)

Yup allows you to rate and see the social value of all content, and earn money and influence for your opinions. You can rate with the Yup Extension on any website, or through overlays on the page itself on Twitter, YouTube, Google Maps, and more.

### How do ratings work?

Yup lets you rate content out of 5 dots - 1/5 is the worst and 5/5 is the best. More opinionated ratings (like 1/5 or 5/5) multiply your earnings, but they cost more! You can only give five 5/5 ratings per day.

The dots are a simplified implementation of quadratic voting. 2/5 and 3/5 are considered low-cost ratings, costing 1 vote each. 1/5 and 4/5 each cost 4 votes, and 5/5, the most extreme, costs 9 votes. Users have 40 votes per 24 hours.

### Using the Extension

Rate any webpage simply by clicking the Yup Extension.

### **Rating on overlaid sites**

Certain websites are integrated directly with Yup. Use the embedded Yup buttons to rate content on Twitter, YouTube, Google Maps, and more.
