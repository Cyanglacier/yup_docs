# Getting Started

## Overview

Yup is a Network that rewards you for good opinions. By doing so, it creates a social consensus layer for the internet, accurately representing the agreed-upon social value of **anything**, from random Tweets to your history professor. It does this by interacting with the Yup Protocol, which is a decentralized semi-autonomous social consensus protocol that determines the rewards and social value of all content based on users' interactions with it. ( [Learn More](https://github.com/Yup-io/yup\_docs/tree/24938ac610bbd465109806ec69fb9e97054f2399/protocol.md) )

It creates a social consensus layer for the Internet, accurately representing the social value of **anything,** from random Tweets to your history professor. It does this through the Yup Protocol, a decentralized, semi-autonomous social consensus protocol. The Yup Protocol determines the social value of content and rewards users for creating and curating it.

The best way to use Yup is the Yup Web Extension, a browser plug-in that allows you to rate any website or piece of content. It also stores your YUP tokens and displays the social value of everything in our color-coded scheme.
