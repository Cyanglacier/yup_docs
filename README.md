### Overview

Yup is a network that rewards you for good opinions. By doing so, it creates a social consensus layer for the internet, accurately representing the agreed-upon social value of **anything**, from random Tweets to your history professor. It does this by interacting with the Yup Protocol, which is a decentralized semi-autonomous social consensus protocol that determines the rewards and social value of all content based on users' interactions with it. ( [Learn More](/protocol.md) )

The best way to use Yup is through the Yup Web Extension, a browser plug-in that allows you to vote on any site or piece of content across the web. It also stores your money and displays the social value of everything in a color coded scheme ( [Learn More](/ext.md) )
