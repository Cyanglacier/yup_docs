# Protocol

The Yup Protocol is a social consensus protocol incentivized by an opinion economy that sits atop the internet. It sets the infrastructure for a new form of social network. Users receive token rewards and build influence on the platform by rating, posting, and curating content. The impact of their ratings and the influence and rewards they receive are proportional to their value as determined by other users. Their assets garnered through staking, engagement, and approval determine the impact of their ratings. The social level mechanism constructs hierarchical governance of the protocol, solving significant digital identity issues, accurate/transparent representation of media, and equitable monetization/ownership of personal information. Fractionalized shares of accounts and communities governed online will encourage fair markets of community-building, entertainment, and advocacy. The network exists within the framework of the protocol.

## Token Model

### YUPX

The YUPX token is an experimental token that is supposed to resemble the YUP token that will soon replace it. It functions as a means of stress-testing the protocol and experimenting with different approaches. YUPX isn’t a speculative asset, but a token; it represents a portion of the YUP pre-mined total supply that will come at the full Yup Protocol Launch.

**Total supply:** 100,000 YUPX

**Token Smart Contract:** yupyupxtoken

The YUP ( Ұ ) token is designed to be a fungible cryptoasset used to increase impact and engage with the Yup network and ad marketplace. New tokens are minted under a strict predetermined schedule. The token reward mechanism mints new Ұ tokens and
distributes them according to the influence function. The advertising marketplace facilitates the exchange of sponsored content and influencers. The account asset exchange allows top accounts to distribute and sell portions of their account in non-fungible tokens.

## Influence

### Overview

Influence is the metric used for weighing token reward distribution, network governance, transparent representation of social value and network commitment rather than token staking. It’s supposed to reflect a user’s social value more accurately than 1-for-1 votes or simple token-weighted schemes.

### Formula

In simple terms:
><l style="font-size:20px;">**Influence = Token Age + Activity + Social Level**</l>

**Token Age** is the sum of the token value of each input transaction into an account multiplied by the number of blocks or periods since each transaction occurred. In simple terms, this is the number of tokens you have and how long you’ve had them.

**Activity** is a measure of how valuable the activity of an account is on the network. Mathematically, this is the sum of all previous rewards received by an account.

**Social Level** is the numerical rank of each account, determined by the orders of all other accounts in a chain that references previous blocks. Simply, this is your social value as determined by all other users.

> It's important to understand that having a very amount of one of these is not enough to have a high influence. You must have a good balance of all three to make it to the top.
