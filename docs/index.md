# Overview

<h2>Yup rewards valuable opinions across the web. Rate anything, earn rewards for accuracy, and gain status in topics that interest you. It integrates with every site and platform, providing a universal influence metric. </h2>

It does this by interacting with the Yup Protocol, which is a decentralized semi-autonomous social consensus protocol that determines the rewards and social value of all content based on users' interactions with it. ( [Learn More](/protocol.md) )

The best way to use Yup is through the Yup Web Extension, a browser plug-in that allows you to vote on any site or piece of content across the web. It also stores your money and displays the social value of everything in a color coded scheme ( [Learn More](/ext.md) )

**It's super easy to use:** Download the extension, sign up, and simply vote. That's all. When others vote the same as you, you get paid.

# Why build Yup?

The Yup.io team simply could not shake the frustration around two important problems:

<l style="font-size:20px;">
<b>1. Users aren't socially equal, yet social metrics are measured as if they are, making social capital easy to manipulate</b></l>

We'd all prefer to get a 'like' from our favorite celebrity than from their weird neighbor, then why do most social networks treat them each as one like? Isn't a follow from a Michelin star chef worth more for your restaurant than one from a random bartender? When all users are treated the same –1 like, 1 follow, 1 share –it becomes far too easy and cheap to fake social capital, leading to fake news, Fyre Festivals, and harmful disinformation. In a world run by tweets and stories, we can't ignore the immense power of online social metrics. How can we better represent the social value of online data?

<l style="font-size:20px;">
<b>2. Opinions are highly under-monetized</b></l>

Currently, less than 0.1% of all reviews and ratings are monetized. Why would users fill out surveys or product reviews if they're not getting paid? Why would they do it honestly without anything to lose or gain? And finally, why aren't they getting paid more for opinions on things they know better than most?

**Yup solves these problems by using them on each other, kind of like Gin and Tonic:** To have a quality representation of valuable influence online (which is worth serious money these days), we need accurate and weighted opinions. To get accurate opinions, we need to make them worth serious money. Yup is designed to reward users for their opinion based on how much it's worth in order to reach an agreement on the social value of everything on the internet.
