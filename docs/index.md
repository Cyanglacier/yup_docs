##  Yup Docs

 [ Website](https://yup.io) [ Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nhmeoaahigiljjdkoagafdccikgojjoi) [ App](https://app.yup.io/) 

## Overview

###  Yup rewards valuable opinions across the web. Rate anything, earn rewards for accuracy, and gain status in topics that interest you. It integrates with every site and platform, providing a universal influence metric.

It does this by interacting with the Yup Protocol, which is a decentralized semi-autonomous social consensus protocol that determines the rewards and social value of all content based on users' interactions with it. \( [Learn More](https://github.com/Yup-io/yup_docs/tree/24938ac610bbd465109806ec69fb9e97054f2399/protocol.md) \)

The best way to use Yup is through the Yup Web Extension, a browser plug-in that allows you to rate on any site or piece of content across the web. It also stores your money and displays the social value of everything in a color coded scheme. \( [Learn More](https://github.com/Yup-io/yup_docs/tree/24938ac610bbd465109806ec69fb9e97054f2399/ext.md) \)

**It's super easy to use:** Download the extension, sign up, and simply rate. That's all. When others rate the same as you, you get paid.
