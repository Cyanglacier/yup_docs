Yup is a social consensus protocol incentivized by an attention economy. It sets the infrastructure for a new forms of social networks. Users receive token rewards and social signaling for media content, curation, and influence on the platform via layered weighted voting and controlled inflation. Their assets garnered through staking, engagement, and approval determine the impact of their votes. The social level mechanism constructs hierarchical governance of the protocol, solving significant digital identity issues, accurate/transparent representation of media, and equitable monetization/ownership of personal information. Fractionalized shares of accounts and communities governed online will encourage fair markets of community-building, entertainment, and advocacy. The network exists within the framework of the protocol.
