# Rating (Dots)

![](/media/dotsw.png)

Yup allows you to rate and see the social value of all content, and earn money/influence for your opinion. You can rate either from the popup on any site or through the page itself on certain sites.

## How is rating calculated?

![](/media/dotgraphw.png)

With Yup, you can rate all content out of 5 dots (like star rating). 1's the lowest, 5's the highest. More extreme ratings (ex: 1/5, 4/5, 5/5) multiply your influence, but they cost more! You can only rate 5/5 three times a day currently.

 The dots are a simplified implementation of quadratic voting. 2/5 and 3/5 are considered low-cost ratings, costing 1 vote each. 1/5 and 4/5 cost 4 votes, and 5/5, the most extreme, costs 9 votes. Users currently have 40 votes a day.

Lists are <b>weighed</b> by each category separately and distinctly. That means that the usage and influence being spent in a category determines its relevance on lists.
