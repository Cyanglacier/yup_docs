# Rating (Dots)

![](/media/dotsw.png)

Yup allows you to rate and see the social value of all content, and earn money and influence for your opinion. You can either rate from the popup on any site or through the page itself on certain sites.

## How do ratings work?

![](/media/dotgraphw.png)

With Yup, you can rate content out of 5 dots - 1/5 is the most negative rating, 5/5 is the most positive (like star rating). Nuanced ratings (ex: 1/5, 2/5, 4/5, 5/5) multiply your earnings, but they cost more! You can only rate content 5/5 five times a day currently.

 The dots are a simplified implementation of quadratic voting. 2/5 and 3/5 are considered low-cost ratings, costing 1 vote each. 1/5 and 4/5 cost 4 votes, and 5/5, the most extreme, costs 9 votes. Users currently have 40 votes a day.

Lists are <b>weighed</b> by each category separately and distinctly. That means that the usage and influence being spent in a category determines its relevance on lists.
