### Access

Currently, you must own a university email (.edu) or receive an access code to use the extension. You can receive one from the Yup team or from an existing user. If you don't have one, apply [here](a) or through the extension.

### Username and Password

All you have to do is pick a username and password and your Yup Account will be created.

### Security Considerations

If you sign up for a *decentralized account*, you should download and save your backup key, in case you lose access to your account for some reason.
