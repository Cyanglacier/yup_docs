## Access

Currently, you must own a university email (.edu) or receive an access code to use the extension.  If you don’t have one, apply [here](https://join.yup.io/) or through the extension. You can receive one from the Yup team or an existing user.

## Security Considerations

If you sign up for a *decentralized account*, you should download and save your backup key, in case you lose access to your account for some reason.
