# Categories

Categories are separate topics, feelings, or adjectives used to describe a user's opinion about some content. These can be upvoted or downvoted to express the positive or negative version of that feeling.

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
  <b>For example, if you like a CNN article, you can upvote in the "like" category, but if you think it's stupid, you can downvote in the "smart" category.</b>
</div>
  <div class="column">
  <img class="img" src="/media/categories.png" style="height:300px;">
</div>
</div>

Voters of specific categories receive rewards on votes of that category. If you think something is smart, you only get rewarded if others do too, not if they think it's funny.

## Current Categories

Here is a running list of categories:

Category      | Description
------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------
like          | how much people like something or how popular it is.
smart         | how much people believe something is smart. General intelligence.
funny         | how much people believe something is funny.
chill         | easy-going about attendance, lateness, etc.
useful        | has important knowledge for your field/career
knowledgeable | for professors, how much they know about the relevant course.
engaging      | captures your attention, makes concepts easy to understand
easy          | can do well without extra effort; generous grading, minimal time
interesting   | compelling subject matter, makes you think
affordable    | for locations, how much it costs to spend time there.
beautiful     | for locations (Google Maps), how pretty a place is.

## Why it matters

In giving opinions on the internet, it's important that we don't loop everything into one category, such as popularity, because it is a poor representation of the content / person's social value within a specific field. Marylin Monroe was more popular than Einstein, but Albert was surely smarter, and Charlie Chaplin was funnier than both! A chef's opinion on food should be more highly valued than an architect's, but when it comes to judging buildings, the chef has no clue. Thus, it's important to distribute influence evenly and thus weight opinions separately.

Over time, we expect to add more and more categories, allowing people to express their opinion more accurately and earn influence in specific fields of expertise. If you have a category you'd like added, [reach out](mailto:community@yup.io)!
