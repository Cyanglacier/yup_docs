# YUPX Token

The YUPX token is an experimental token that is supposed to resemble the YUP token that will soon replace it. It functions as a means of stress-testing the protocol and experimenting with various approaches. While it isn't traded publicly yet, it represents 0.1% of the YUP pre-mined total supply that will come. This means that any YUPX tokens that you have will convert into YUP tokens when the time arrives.

**Total supply:** 100,000 YUPX

**Percentage of YUP premined supply:** 0.1%

**Token Smart Contract:** yupyupxtoken
