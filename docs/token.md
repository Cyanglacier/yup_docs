# Token Model

## YUPX

The YUPX token is an experimental token that is supposed to resemble the YUP token that will soon replace it. It functions as a means of stress-testing the protocol and experimenting with various approaches. YUPX isn't a speculative asset, but a token; it represents a portion of the YUP pre-mined total supply that will come at the full Yup Protocol Launch.


**Total supply:** 100,000 YUPX

**Token Smart Contract:** yupyupxtoken

The YUP ( Ұ ) token is designed to be a fungible cryptoasset used to increase impact and engage with the Yup network and ad marketplace. New tokens are minted under a strict predetermined schedule. The token reward mechanism mints new Ұ tokens and
distributes them according to the influence function. The advertising marketplace facilitates the exchange of sponsored content and influencers. The account asset exchange allows top accounts to distribute and sell portions of their account in non-fungible tokens.
