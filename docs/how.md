# How to Use

The Yup extension is meant to allow you to vote on any content, see the social value of all content, and get paid for your opinion. You can vote either from the popup on any site or through the page itself on certain sites.

## Voting on any site

You can vote on any webpage simply by opening the popup while surfing that page. Click on the Yup button on the top right of your web browser to open the popup.

## Voting on overlaid sites

You can vote on overlaid sites directly from the page itself, using the inscribed Yup button there.

Yup currently overlays on certain sites of the internet:

1. Twitter
