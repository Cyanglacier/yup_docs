# Rewards

## How to make money

Users can make money by voting. These can be significant and be withdrawn as US dollars. YUPX tokens are distributed as rewards, and users can swap them for $$ credits on Amazon, Venmo, and PayPal.

### The Process

1. You give your opinion by upvoting or downvoting content.
2. The Yup protocol determines a money value for your vote and rewards that money to all previous voters with the same opinion AND the creator of the content.
3. Someone else gives that same opinion for the same content.
4. You get paid a portion of the money value of their vote.
5. And so on! The more votes after you, the more you earn.

### Not all votes get rewards

Your own opinion doesn't simply make you money because you expressed it. It's only worth something if others agree. If nobody votes the same as you after you, it means you're either late on that opinion or it's a bad opinion, so you don't get any money.

### More influence more money

Your influence (IN) is a measure of your social value on Yup. Currently, it's mostly a measure of your YUPX token holdings and rewards you've previously received. Over time, we'll implement a full version of the Yup protocol. ( [Learn More](/influence.md) )

## Withdrawal

Today, you can withdraw with Amazon, PayPal, and Venmo, as well as to another blockchain account. Users can withdraw by clicking *Menu > Withdraw > [method]*

Here's an example with Amazon:
<div class="row">
  <div class="column"><img class="img" src="/media/menu.png"></img></div>
  <div class="column"><img class="img" src="/media/txn.png"></img></div>
  <div class="column"><img class="img" src="/media/txn_amazon.png"></img></div>
</div>

** In the future, we will replace YUPX tokens with YUP tokens that have market value where the tokens would be tradable and liquid (enough).
