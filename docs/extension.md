# Yup Extension

## Getting Started
___
### Download the Site

Yup uses EOS as a blockchain and Scatter as a wallet. Scatter holds your info and crypto, and signs transactions with your approval. To use Yup, you need a Scatter wallet with an EOS account inside. You must first download theÂ **Scatter Desktop** app. Once you have that set up, you need to add a private key to unlock your EOS account.

### Step 1: Download Scatter Desktop

Scatter Desktop is the most secure way to interact with Yup. This is the recommended way to use Yup.Â [Download Scatter Desktop.](https://get-scatter.com/download)

**Note:**Â the Scatter Chrome extension is deprecated and cannot be used to interact with Yup.

### Step 2: Add EOS Account

### Option 1: Existing EOS Account

If you have an EOS account, either given by us, another app, or opened yourself elsewhere, you can add it to Scatter by adding your private key. Once added, you link it to your account.

### Option 2: New EOS Address

To start from scratch, you need to pay to set up an EOS account. Here are 3 ways to do so:1.Â [ZEOS](https://www.zeos.co/en/home)Â Create account and pay with BTC/ETH/BCH. Cost: ~$1Â 2.Â [EOS Lynx](https://eoslynx.com/)Â Mobile app that lets you create account and pay with Credit Card (Apple Pay). You can also use Yup through Lynx. Cost: $0.99Â 3.Â [EOS Vibes](https://eos-account-creator.com/choose/)Â Create account and pay with Credit Card online. Cost: $6.99Â Once you're done with this, you will have an account name and key pair that you can add to Scatter.

### You're all set! Enjoy.Â ðŸ˜Š

### Extra Credit

### Whitelisting Transactions

EOS allows you to 'whitelist' transactions, meaning you don't have to re-sign every time you do an action on the blockchain. This makes for a much better Yup experience and is highly recommended.
