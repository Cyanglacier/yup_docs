# Influence

## Overview

Influence is the metric used for weighing token reward distribution, network governance, and transparent representation of social value and network commitment rather than token staking. It's supposed to reflect a user's social value more accurately than 1-for-1 votes or simply token-weighted schemes.

## Formula

In simple terms:
><l style="font-size:20px;">**Influence = Token Age + Activity + Social Level**</l>

**Token Age** is the sum of the token value of each input transaction into an account multiplied by the number of blocks or periods since each transaction occurred. In simple terms, this is the amount of tokens you have and how long you've had them.

**Activity** is a measure of how valuable the activity of an account is on the network. Mathematically, this is the sum of all previous rewards received by an account.

**Social Level** is the numerical rank of each account, determined by the orders of all other accounts in a chain that references previous blocks. Simply, this is your social value as determined by all other users.

> It's important to understand that having a very amount of one of these is not enough to have a high influence. You must have a good balance of all three to make it to the top.
